An extension that enables you to add a `filename` attribute to code blocks, which is useful if you are documenting the contents of a file and want to be especially clear about the name of the file the code is associated with. 

For example, the following markdown:

````default
```{.python filename="matplotlib.py"}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
```
````

Yields this output:

```{.python filename="matplotlib.py"}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
```

Non-HTML formats will still have the filename, but it will simply be shown in bold above the code block.
